## To find all docker commands

## docker commands syntax

## Image vs Container
- Image is an application we want to run.
- Container is an instance of that image running as a process.
- We can have multiple containers with the same image.

## docker container run --publish 80:80 nginx
- Will download image from docker hub if not found locally.
- Started new container from that image
- Opened port 80 on the host IP
- Routes the traffic to the container IP, port 80.
- Will run it on the foreground

## docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach nginx
- Same as above but will run image in the background.
- returns a unique container Id.
