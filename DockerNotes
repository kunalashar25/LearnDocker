## To find all docker commands
- docker

## docker commands syntax
- docker <managementCommands> <subCommands> (options)

## Image vs Container
- Image is an application we want to run.
- Container is an instance of that image running as a process.
- We can have multiple containers with the same image.

## docker container run --publish 80:80 nginx
- Will download image from docker hub (latest version) if not found locally in image cache.
- Started new container from that image and prepares to start.
- Opened port 80 on the host IP
- Routes the traffic to the container IP, port 80.
- Will run it on the foreground

## Background work when we type `docker container run`
- looks for the image locally in the image cache. If not found.
- looks in the remote image repository (docker hub)
- download the latest version(by default)
- creates a new container based on the image and prepare to start.
- gives it a virtual IP on a private network inside docker engine.
- open up host port and routes the traffic to the container port.
- starts container by using the command specified in the image docker file.

## docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach nginx
- Same as above but will run image in the background.
- returns a unique container Id.
